The goal for this project is to make a helpful or not helpful robot.

# Project : Coffee Stirring machine!

## Description
For many including me, a coffee in the morning is mandatory to drive them through the day. One of the steps in making any good coffee is giving it a good stir. Taking inspiration from inventor Simone Giertz, I wanted to create a coffee stirring machine. This simple machine will stir your coffee when you place your cup on it.


### Working
1. Place you cup on the marked location.
2. The machine does its job.
3. Take out the cup. Enjoy your perfectly stirred coffee!

### Challenges
1. Due to the limited availability of resources, the scale of the project is reduced.
