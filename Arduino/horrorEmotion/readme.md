# Representing the horror emotion
The goal of the project is to represent the horror emotion using lights and paper. I created a projector using paper shaped into cylinders and using cut paper to create different scenes.

## Initial ideas
1. I wanted to recreate the classical "light under the face" horror effect. For this, I created a face mask using a template and I used red and blue lights under the face to create this effect. However, the face mask was not realistic enough to create this emotion.

2. I switched to the idea of a light box which works by having LEDs inside a box and using layers of cutout papers to cast shadows on a screen.

## The sculpture
The sculpture consists of the following pieces
1. Two projection tubes made using the Template Marker site. 
2. Two different outlines - illustrated and cut using the cricut paper cutting machine.
3. A box to hold the projection tubes and a screen to create a theater effect.
